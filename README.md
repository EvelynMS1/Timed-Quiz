# Timed-Quiz ![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

## Description
The endeavor of starting this application was to facilitate the structure of my application using functions especially the setTimeout function. Knowing when to use it and how it would work with other functions within the application, fundamentally understanding the effect that it had and when it ran. I built this application for the purpose of understanding how to use different element types to achieve a goal. In this case the use of arrays and objects. This project solves the problem of not having a resourceful tool for studying material. Therefore this application was designed in a quiz format for individuals to quiz themselves in a timed fashion. I learned how to use the local Storage within the Document Object Model for information to be stored and used for later purposes.
